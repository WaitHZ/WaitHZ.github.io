I am a third-year undergraduate student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/)'s [CKC College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/), majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I am exploring my research interests and continuously enhancing my abilities. My current interest is focused on **Modular Deep Learning**, which I consider to be an important pathway towards the development of System-2. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to contact me for further discussion via email.
